# Ollama Chat App

A full-stack, real-time AI chat application built by **Rajat Sharma**. This project features a modern React frontend and a Node.js backend that streams responses from a locally running Ollama LLM (e.g., Mistral). The UI is inspired by ChatGPT and is fully responsive, modular, and easy to extend.
